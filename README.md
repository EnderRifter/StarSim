# StarSim
Some coursework for the OCR A-Level 2015 specification.

# Description
A solar system simulator, that will be viewed in 3 dimensions, that accurately simulates the orbits of bodies around each other.

# Features
- Allows a user to generate a random solar system
- Allows a user to place a body from a database of known bodies into the solar system
- Allows a user to view the surface a given body
- Allows a user to simulate the solar system with as high an accuracy as possible
- Advanced algorithms would be used to ensure that the attraction between the bodies was calculated efficiently

# Stakeholders
- Teachers teaching the basics of physics and the solar system in an interactive manner
- Astronomy enthusiasts who want to simulate given solar systems
- Casual users who find astronomy interesting and want to play around with random solar systems and watch them evolve over time

# Miscellaneous Details
Uses Entitiy Framework Core with a SQLite backend for ease of use and portability.
